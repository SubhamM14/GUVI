The way JSON iterates over the different for loops are:

1. 'For' Loop:
~ in case of this loop, the value is first set with an approximate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’.
~ then the terminal or the final value of the loop is specified.
eg:
var numbers = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
for (var i=0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
   console.log(numbers[i])
}

Here, 'i' is initialised by zero and the terminal value is set to be the length of the given array. 
For loop will iterate through the array and the loop will run as long as 'i' does not match the terminal value.

2. 'For In' Loop:
~ unlike the For Loop, no counter is used in this loop which makes the iterartion process even morer simple and hassle-free.
eg:
var student = {
   firstname: "Subham",
   lastname: "JMukherjee",
   age: 22
}; 
for (let x in student) {
   console.log(x + ": "+ student[x])
} 

Here, the loop iterates through the object and looks up each property as well as the value it carries.

3. 'forEach' Loop:
~ This method is essentially used for looping through an array element.
eg:
var employees = ["Jake", "Terry", "Amy", "Holt", "Rosa"];
employees.forEach(function1);
function function1(currentValue, index) {
   console.log("Index in array is: "+index + " ::  Value is: "+currentValue);
}

Here, the loop iterates through each element of the loop and returns the necessary value.
