The 5 differences between Browser JS(console) and Node JS are as follows: 

~ Browser JS(console):
1. "window" is present as a predefined object and they consist of functions and attributes that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
2. another predefined object in the browsers happen to be the "location" which consists of a;ll the information about the URL loaded by us.
3. the predefined object named "document" has the html which is rendered.
4. an object named "global" may be present in the browser but it will be the exact same as "window".
5. the object "require" is not predefined but you may add it in the app for asynchronous file loading.

~ Node JS:
1. there is no such predefined object as "window" as there is no window that Node JS needs to draw.
2. Node JS does not require the "location" object as it is realted to a particular page and happens to be page specific.
3. as Node JS does not have to render anything in a paghe, there is also an absense of "document" object.
4. a "global" predefined object is present in Node JS which consistsseveral functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
5. the "require" object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
