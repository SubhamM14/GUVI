Q: How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
   a. var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
   b. var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

Ans:

When there is a need to compare two JSON irrespective of their order, the best way to do so is with the help of Lodash's.isEqual().
With the help of this method we can check if the contents of JSON are similar or not.
Like with the given example, we can implement the method in the following way:

var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
if(_.isEqual(bob, bill)){
    console.log("equal");
}else{
	console.log("not equal");
}
